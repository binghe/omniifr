omniORB-4.0.3 and omniORBpy-2.3 both have know problems that affect the
InterfaceRepository:

omniORBpy-2.3-keywords.patch -
  Fixes a crashing bug in omniORBpy 2.3 (and
  earlier) triggered by IDL identifiers that are also python keywords.

omniORB-4.0.3-get_interface.patch -
  Fixes a bug in omniORB 4.0.3 (and earlier)
  that caused Object::_get_interface() to always return nil.
