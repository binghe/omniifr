omniIFR 2.pre.1

omniIFR 2.pre.0
---------------

Complete re-write. omniIFR2 has virtually no code in common with version 1.
Nevertheless I owe a great deal to the original authors. Version 2 evolved
over several months, using the older code as scaffolding to support it while
it took shape.

omniifr v1.1.4
--------------

This was the original code written by David Reyes i Forniés and
Àlex Bassas i Serramià of factoriaX. It was rescued by Duncan Grisby, who
created the Sourceforge project for it.
