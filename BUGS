 o Recursive type codes are not properly generated. Instead of the correct
   recursive type, an empty or partially formed type code is embedded inside
   the 'parent' type code.

BUGS IN OLD VERSIONS OF OMNIORB:

 o If your IDL includes python keywords used as IDL identifiers, then
   omniORBpy version 2.3 (and earlier) will crash. This is a bug in omniORBpy.
   The patch in `patch/omniORBpy-2.3-keywords.patch' fixes this problem.
   
 o omniORB's implementation of CORBA::Object::_get_interface() method DOES NOT
   WORK. It always returns a nil reference, even when it has successfully
   obtained a definition from the Interface Repository.

   WORKAROUND: The following files contain a get_interface() function that
   works as an alternative to _get_interface(). They use non-portable omniORB
   features.

     browser/IfrConnection.h - C++
     browser/ifrconnection.py - Python
